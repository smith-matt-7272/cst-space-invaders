You will require a BinFiles directory in your project directory.

Still to do:

Bugs:
Still get ConcurrentModificationException occasionally when UFO is hit. (Line 760)
Something to do with it being in an ArrayList.  Converting from an ArrayList
to an Array is a possible solution according to research.

Missiles/explosions still exist after a round is completed, and a scene has changed.
Can result in UFO being destroyed from a missile fired in a previous round.

Extra buttons occasionally are created during a screen transition.  Likely due to
thread timing that triggers the transition.

Occasionally adds an extra "kill" or "level", again, likely due to thread timing
which trigger those increments.  Can lead to unsynced kills/level numbers.

The "shimmy" feature seems to fail.  Can't seem to manage it to evenly 

Clean up:
The load screens are a disastrous monstrosity.  Separate the Scenes/panes into
a separate class(es).

Not sure if passing the same stage through the whole process makes the best sense,
or if creating new stages would be better?

Create a separate class for UFOs and for missiles, so the individual objects can
have their own properties instead of depending on full-scope variables.

Ideas to Implement:
Some sort of upgrade system.  During transition screen, player can assign "upgrades"
which may improve missile speed, reduce reload, increase launcher move speed.
Background effects; a more dynamic background which gives the impression that the
UFO invasion is a "global" conflict
