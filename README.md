# cst-space-invaders
This project was a solo assignment completed during first year CST Java programming.  It largely demonstrates the use of threading to control an interactive JavaFX program with independently active sprites.  It also demonstrates the use of File IO via a Random-Access-File which stores a high-scores list.

# Comments
As it was a first year project, it naturally has plenty of bugs that can still be worked out, and plenty of game balancing needed to make it challenging but still achievable.
